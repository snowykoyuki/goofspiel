Goofspiel is a card game for two players, using cards from a standard deck of cards. 

Each suit is ranked, i.e. ace is worth one point, 2 is two points, etc., jack 11, queen 12, and king 13 points. 

One suit is singled out as the "prizes"; each of the remaining suits becomes a hand for one player, with one suit discarded. 

The prize cards are shuffled and placed between the players with one card turned up. Play proceeds in a series of rounds. The players make sealed bids for the top (face up) prize by selecting a card from their hand (keeping their choice secret from their opponent). 

Once these cards are selected, they are simultaneously revealed, and the player making the highest bid takes the prize card. If there is a tie, the prize card value is equally split between the tied players. The cards used for bidding are discarded, and play continues with a new upturned prize card.

After 13 rounds, there are no remaining cards and the game ends. The player who has gained the highest sum of the prize cards wins the game.
